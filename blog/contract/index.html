    <h1>Contract Work</h1>    

    <p>
        I am currently available to take on some limited contract work. This is occasionally development work, sometimes debugging work, and often training or design work. My specialties are asynchronous and parallel programming, but I have a wide variety of experience including embedded systems, desktop and mobile apps, web APIs, and cloud-native applications. My standard rate is $250/hr (note that "an hour" with me tends to go pretty far).
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are interested in hiring me for contract work, <a href="#" class="email-link">send me an email</a> with "contract work" in the subject line and a short description of what your needs are, and we can discuss.
