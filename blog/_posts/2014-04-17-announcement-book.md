I am very pleased to announce that I have finished writing a **book!**





The title is quite a mouthful: [Concurrency in C# Cookbook: Asynchronous, Parallel, and Multithreaded Programming](http://tinyurl.com/ConcurrencyCookbook). The goal of this book is to introduce developers to asynchronous, parallel, and reactive code in a way that is helpful and down-to-earth.

I have to say that writing this book took a lot more time than I originally thought! I should be able to resume a more normal pace of blogging shortly. :)
