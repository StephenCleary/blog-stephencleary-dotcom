Today I'd like to say happy birthday to the `async` and `await` keywords!

TODO: F#, then C#/VB.
F# April 12, 2010
C#/VB September 12, 2012

Adoption by other languages: Python, TypeScript, Hack (Facebook's PHP), Dart, (soon) JavaScript and C++.

Why is async taking over the world? Cloud and mobile.
