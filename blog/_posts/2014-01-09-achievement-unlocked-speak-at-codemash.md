title: "Achievement Unlocked: Speak at CodeMash"
---
I'm pleased to say that I'm now a CodeMash speaker! I gave a talk this morning on "Async on the Server." This talk was an introduction to async/await on ASP.NET.



The [slides are available](https://github.com/TechConf/CodeMash2014/tree/master/Async%20on%20the%20Server) on the unofficial CodeMash speaker repo on GitHub. I'll put up another post if the video turns out OK (my video camera is quite old and it was taking non-HD interlaced video).
