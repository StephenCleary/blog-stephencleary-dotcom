title: "ArraySegments Library Available"
---
Yesterday I officially released the ArraySegments library on [NuGet](https://nuget.org/packages/ArraySegments) and [GitHub](https://github.com/StephenCleary/ArraySegments).

It's a very small library designed to give the [ArraySegment\<T>](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/1hsbd92d.aspx?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-5000058) a bit of love. It's especially useful when dealing with large amounts of binary data.

Enjoy!
