Yesterday I officially released the ArraySegments library on [NuGet](https://nuget.org/packages/ArraySegments) and [CodePlex](http://arraysegments.codeplex.com/).





It's a very small library designed to give the [ArraySegment<T>](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/1hsbd92d.aspx) a bit of love. It's especially useful when dealing with large amounts of binary data.





Enjoy!
