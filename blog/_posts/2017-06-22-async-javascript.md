title: "Async JavaScript"
description: "Async and Await are about to officially become part of JavaScript!"
---

The `async` and `await` keywords first hit the scene way back in 2010, when it was introduced in F#. C# and VB followed fairly quickly in 2012, with Python and TypeScript adopting them in 2015.

Tuesday or Wednesday next week (the 27th and 28th of June), `async` should officially become a part of JavaScript!

That is, the [`async` proposal](https://github.com/tc39/ecmascript-asyncawait) [has reached](https://github.com/tc39/proposals/blob/master/finished-proposals.md) [Stage 4](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/), is included in the [ES2017 language specification](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/2017/), and is expected to be ratified [next week](https://www.ecma-international.org/memento/Ecma_meeting_calendar.htm).

Of course, JavaScript being what it is, lots of people have been [using it for some time already](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-async-to-generator/). Chrome even has [native support](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/async-functions)!

JavaScript is perhaps the most widely-used language today, and this marks a big step forward in the `async` invasion. Stay tuned on this blog for JavaScript-related `async` tips in addition to the regular .NET ones! :)

Way to go, `async`!
