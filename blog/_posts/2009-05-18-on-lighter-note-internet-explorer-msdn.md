The other day (on May 2nd, to be exact), I was using Internet Explorer (version 8, no less) to answer some questions on the MSDN forums site. Suddenly, I was confronted with this "error non-message".





Generally speaking, this site works very well... as long as you've got a high-speed Internet connection that never gets interrupted. However, if you're trying to do a download in the background on a wireless connection to a shared Internet connection that is the slowest of the "high-speeds", then the MSDN forums pages begin to show their quirks.





I find error messages - especially bad ones - to be interesting. I especially like the warning icon; it just brings real meaning to this screenshot. :)
