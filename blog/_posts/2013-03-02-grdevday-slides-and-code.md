title: "GRDevDay Slides and Code"
---
I had a wonderful time at [GRDevDay](http://grdevday.org) today! The [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/stephencleary/intermediate-async) and [sources](https://github.com/StephenCleary/Presentations-IntermediateAsync) for my "Intermediate Async" talk are now available.



Special thanks go out to the few, brave souls who were willing to come to my talk. :) And of course the incredible GRDevDay team and the great sponsors who keep this conference so inexpensive!
