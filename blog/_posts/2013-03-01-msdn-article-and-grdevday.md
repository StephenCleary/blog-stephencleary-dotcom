We interrupt this blog series to bring you a special announcement.

[My MSDN Magazine article "Best Practices in Asynchronous Programming" has been published](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/jj991977.aspx). I'm not sure what's up with the MSDN Magazine table CSS; the layout looks rather poor IMO.

Anyway, please check it out, _especially_ if you are attending my "Intermediate Async" talk [tomorrow at GRDevDay](http://grdevday.org/)! Tomorrow we'll be delving to a level of `async` that AFAIK has never been presented, starting with a gentle overview of TPL Dataflow and then diving pretty deep into the implementation of `AsyncLazy<T>` and `AsyncLock`, exploring some new concepts and pointing out pitfalls as we go.
