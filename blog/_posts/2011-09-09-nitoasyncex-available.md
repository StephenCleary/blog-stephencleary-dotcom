title: "Nito.AsyncEx Available"

Nito.AsyncEx is [now available](http://nitoasyncex.codeplex.com/).

Just as the [Nito.Async](http://nitoasync.codeplex.com/) library helps you work with the Event-Based Asynchronous Pattern (and its underlying concepts such as SynchronizationContext), the [Nito.AsyncEx](http://nitoasyncex.codeplex.com/) library helps you work with the Task-Based Asynchronous Pattern (and its underlying concepts such as Task).
