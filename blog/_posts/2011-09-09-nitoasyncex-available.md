Nito.AsyncEx is [now available](https://github.com/StephenCleary/AsyncEx).

Just as the [Nito.Async](https://github.com/StephenClearyArchive/Nito.Asynchronous) library helps you work with the Event-Based Asynchronous Pattern (and its underlying concepts such as SynchronizationContext), the [Nito.AsyncEx](https://github.com/StephenCleary/AsyncEx) library helps you work with the Task-Based Asynchronous Pattern (and its underlying concepts such as Task).
