I have [uploaded the slides](https://github.com/StephenCleary/Presentations/tree/0959859f132483d293bc35e1ad7284d18084f632/Understanding%20Ethereum%20Application%20Development) for the [talk I gave a couple weeks ago at Code PaLOUsa 2018, entitled "Understanding Ethereum Application Development"](http://www.codepalousa.com/Sessions/1115).

This talk is more of a conceptual overview of Ethereum application development, covering questions like "what does it mean to *run* on the blockchain?" and "what's the point of an oracle?" It does not cover the details of the Solidity language.
