This is the first post of an "announcement week". It just so happens that I have a few announcements to make, so this week instead of my regular posts I'll be posting only announcements.





The first announcement is this: I've reached over 200 posts on my blog! (This post is actually number 208). I hardly ever look at my blog stats, but I thought today I'll make an exception since this is sort of a blog post that's about this blog...





All together, my blog has had more than 400,000 pageviews since I published my [first post](http://blog.stephencleary.com/2008/06/interop-on-64-bit-platforms.html) in June of '08.





The vast majority of my readers come from Google or Stack Overflow, which means that they won't actually see this message. Thanks to those of you who _are_ reading this! :)





The all-time "most famous" posts are currently:




1. The (quite old) [Reporting Progress from Tasks](http://blog.stephencleary.com/2010/06/reporting-progress-from-tasks.html).
1. My [Async and Await Intro](http://blog.stephencleary.com/2012/02/async-and-await.html) (of course).
1. [Detection of Half-Open (Dropped) Connections](http://blog.stephencleary.com/2009/05/detection-of-half-open-dropped.html), part of my TCP/IP .NET Sockets FAQ.




However, if you look at recent trends, [Reporting Progress from Tasks](http://blog.stephencleary.com/2010/06/reporting-progress-from-tasks.html) is heading down in the rankings while [Async and Await](http://blog.stephencleary.com/2012/02/async-and-await.html) is coming up fast. So I'd expect the all-time rankings to change soon.





I'd like to close with a big "thank you" to all my readers out there! If you're reading this, you're probably a "regular", so _special_ thanks to you for putting up with my crazy talk on a regular basis! :)
