title: "Announcement: Over 200 Posts!"
---
This is the first post of an "announcement week". It just so happens that I have a few announcements to make, so this week instead of my regular posts I'll be posting only announcements.



The first announcement is this: I've reached over 200 posts on my blog! (This post is actually number 208). I hardly ever look at my blog stats, but I thought today I'll make an exception since this is sort of a blog post that's about this blog...



All together, my blog has had more than 400,000 pageviews since I published my [first post]({% post_url 2008-06-20-interop-on-64-bit-platforms %}) in June of '08.



The vast majority of my readers come from Google or Stack Overflow, which means that they won't actually see this message. Thanks to those of you who _are_ reading this! :)



The all-time "most famous" posts are currently:




1. The (quite old) [Reporting Progress from Tasks]({% post_url 2010-06-18-reporting-progress-from-tasks %}).
1. My [Async and Await Intro]({% post_url 2012-02-02-async-and-await %}) (of course).
1. [Detection of Half-Open (Dropped) Connections]({% post_url 2009-05-16-detection-of-half-open-dropped %}), part of my TCP/IP .NET Sockets FAQ.


However, if you look at recent trends, [Reporting Progress from Tasks]({% post_url 2010-06-18-reporting-progress-from-tasks %}) is heading down in the rankings while [Async and Await]({% post_url 2012-02-02-async-and-await %}) is coming up fast. So I'd expect the all-time rankings to change soon.



I'd like to close with a big "thank you" to all my readers out there! If you're reading this, you're probably a "regular", so _special_ thanks to you for putting up with my crazy talk on a regular basis! :)
