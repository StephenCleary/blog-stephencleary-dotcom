title: "70-536 In the Bag"
---
I haven't been blogging a great deal the last week or so. I wish I could say it was because I was studying for the [70-536](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/Exam.aspx?ID=70-536), but the truth is that it's because I have a 6-week-old at home. :)

Saturday morning, I was a little nervous to be taking my first MS certification exam without adequate preparation, but I said a short prayer and hopped in the car (the closest exam site is about 3 hours away). The exam oversight guy (I'm sure he has a more proper title...) stated that I passed "with flying colors" (and seemed almost surprised!). So, I give thanks to God for that one; it sure wasn't because I was prepared for it!

I wasn't able to get the [MCTS Self-Paced Training Kit](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735626197?ie=UTF8&tag=stepheclearys-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0735626197), which would have been nice to have, but I did find the book [Professional C#](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470191376?ie=UTF8&tag=stepheclearys-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0470191376) (which I already owned) to be very helpful. I was able to shore up some weak areas (e.g., caspol), but didn't have time for others (e.g., globalization).

So, now I may be an MCP. Or maybe not. The web page is pretty ambiguous on the topic. If I understand it correctly, I'm not an MCP but I'm allowed to use the MCP logo. Go figure on that one. It doesn't matter a great deal, because I've signed up for [70-505](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?ID=70-505) and [70-563](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?ID=70-563) in two weeks. After 70-505, I'll be an MCP/MCTS, and by the end of the day, I'll be an MCP/MCTS/MCPD. If I pass. :)

Hopefully the baby will let me study for these ones. :)  Or maybe I'll finally learn that I can't do everything. :)
