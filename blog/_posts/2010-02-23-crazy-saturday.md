title: "Crazy Saturday"
---
My MCPD logo has been updated to include my new ASP.NET and Enterprise certifications. They were the result of a Crazy Saturday.



This last Saturday, February 20th, there was a fundraising dinner in Grand Rapids for the [Constitution Party](http://www.constitutionparty.com/). Since we were going to be in town anyway, we figured I should go ahead and take a couple of certification exams. (Grand Rapids is ~3.5 hours away from our house, and that's where the closest testing center is). Due to various difficulties, I had almost no time to prepare for the exams.



Due to a scheduling bug on Prometric's website, I was able to schedule overlapping exams. I originally planned to take three exams (just getting the Enterprise certification), but trimmed it down to two because I didn't want the stress. Leaving the house at 5:30am, we got to the testing center right when they opened at 9:30.



After taking [70-561 (TS: ADO.NET)](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?ID=70-561) and [70-562 (TS: ASP.NET)](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?ID=70-562), I still had a bit of time. The "expected time" for those exams was 3:45 and 3:30, respectively, but it was only 11:45 when I finished (including a break for breakfast).



The test administrators were really nice and suggested that I "quick-test" another one... if I could help them figure out how to do it using their Prometric control panel application. I decided to try to take _both_ remaining tests, which would save me a trip down in March. The only catch was that I had to finish the next test in a very short time, because the last test _had_ to start by 1pm (it was 3 hours long and the testing center closed at 4:00).



Fortunately, I finished [70-565 (PRO: Enterprise)](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?ID=70-565) in about 45 minutes, with just enough time to schedule [70-564 (PRO: ASP.NET)](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?ID=70-564). I had a full three hours for that exam, but ended up leaving at around 1:45pm. By that time, I was hungry. :)



My wife was pleased when I told her that I had taken four tests instead of two that day, meaning that March 13th would now be spent at home instead of in Grand Rapids. I was a little wiped out during the fundraising dinner, though.



Four exams; total "expected time" of 13:15; completed in a little over four hours; earning two MCPD certifications. Crazy Saturday!



Even if my [previous experience]({% post_url 2009-09-26-mcpd-achieved %}) hadn't taught me, this last weekend sure would have: Jesus Christ is an awesome God to serve! He assisted me in each step of this process, and I encourage any of my readers to get to know Him! If you're interested in knowing Him, the [first step is getting saved](http://www.landmarkbaptist.ws/salvation). Feel free to contact me if you have any questions!
