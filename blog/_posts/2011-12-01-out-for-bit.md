There are several things that I was planning to do over the last week or two:




- Collect my slides, notes, and demos for my "Thread is Dead" talk recently given at GRDevDay.
- Update Nito.AsyncEx to support Silverlight 5 and possibly also Windows Phone.
- Finish my "command line parsing" series of blog posts, and start a new series looking at "async in the real world" - essentially my "Thread is Dead" talk broken up into a couple dozen posts.




Unfortunately, sometimes the unexpected happens. My two-year-old son [has been diagnosed](http://sdcleary.blogspot.com/) with Leukemia, and I am writing this far from home in his hospital room.





I do still plan to do all of the things listed above, but they won't get done as soon as I was hoping. My apologies especially to the GRDevDay people!
