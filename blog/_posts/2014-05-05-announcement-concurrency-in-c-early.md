title: "Announcement: Concurrency in C# Early Release Ebook Available"
---
My editor at O'Reilly was able to get my book into the O'Reilly's Early Release program at the last minute. So, you can buy it today through the Early Release program and get the final eBook when it's completed shortly (it's really just proofreading and formatting at this point).

Don't forget to use [discount code DRM2014](http://shop.oreilly.com/category/deals/day-against-drm.do) for 50% off! And thanks to my editor for slipping [my book](http://tinyurl.com/ConcurrencyCookbook) into the Early Release program so you can get that sale! :)
