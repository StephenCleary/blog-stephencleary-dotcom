I'm pleased to announce that I'm returning to ThatConference this year (in August of 2015). My session is [Unit Testing Asynchronous Code](https://www.thatconference.com/sessions/session/6993).

I've given this talk a few times in the past - at GRDevDay and CodeMash - but based on feedback, I'll be updating it to include more mocking and assertion frameworks. It should end up being quite a comprehensive overview, including the current state of async support for unit testing as well as a general conceptual overview.

So every little bit helps. :)
