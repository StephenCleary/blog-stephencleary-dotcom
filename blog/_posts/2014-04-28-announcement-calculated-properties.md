I am pleased to announce the creation of my latest library: [calculated properties for C# MVVM apps](https://github.com/StephenCleary/CalculatedProperties).





The goal of this library is to be as easy-to-use as possible, and to be an actual _library_ rather than a _framework_. Calculated properties should work just fine with MvvmCross, Caliburn.Micro, or any other framework of choice.
