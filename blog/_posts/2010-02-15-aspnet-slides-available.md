title: "ASP.NET Slides Available"
---
Last week I gave my first ASP.NET-oriented presentation, "ASP.NET MVC, Silverlight, and jQuery as Friends" (slides available [here](http://nmichigan.net/2010/02/great-asp-net-presentation-in-traverse-city-mi/)). There's a lot of setup tips to get those technologies working together (using VS2008 SP1).

I used my [church website](http://www.landmarkbaptist.ws/) as an example of a static site I recently transitioned to ASP.NET MVC. The most interesting element of this website is the Silverlight menu. Just like CSS/JavaScript menus, it builds itself dynamically from <ul>'s containing <a>'s. In the talk I also covered less common aspects in this site: using ASP.NET routing to ensure the old links to *.html pages stay functional, and how to build your own HTML helpers (and why they aren't as useful as one might think).

All in all, it was much better than my first talk. :)
