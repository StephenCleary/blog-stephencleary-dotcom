I'll be speaking at the [MKE DOT NET conference](http://www.mkedotnet.com/) in Milwaukee, WI on October 29th!

My topic is [Asynchronous? Parallel? Reactive? HELP!](http://www.mkedotnet.com/sessions/asynchronous-parallel-reactive-help/), which is a gentle introduction to various forms of concurrency, with guidance on how to choose between them.
