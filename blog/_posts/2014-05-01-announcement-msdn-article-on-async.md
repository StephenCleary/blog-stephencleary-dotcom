My latest MSDN article [Patterns for Asynchronous MVVM Applications: Services](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn683795.aspx) is online! The title is a slight misnomer, since the article is actually applicable to asynchronous services in _any_ kind of application (including Console and ASP.NET apps).

I cover a pretty wide range of topics in a single article. It's kind of like a trimmed-down version of my [async OOP series](http://blog.stephencleary.com/search/label/async%20oop) from a while ago. Today's MSDN article considers how `async` interacts with inheritance, unit testing, factories, lazy initialization, and constructors.
