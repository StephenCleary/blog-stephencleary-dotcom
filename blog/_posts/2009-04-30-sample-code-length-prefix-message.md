The necessity of message framing is discussed at [https://blog.stephencleary.com/2009/04/message-framing.html]({% post_url 2009-04-30-message-framing %}).

The class below is a modified version of Nito.Async.Sockets.SocketPacketProtocol from the [Nito.Async](https://github.com/StephenClearyArchive/Nito.Asynchronous) library. The main difference is that the Nito.Async.Sockets.SocketPacketProtocol class communicates directly with the asynchronous Nito socket classes, allowing a more efficient implementation. The PacketProtocol class below is slightly less efficient, but can be used with any socket classes, including synchronous sockets or even non-socket streams such as files.

Note that PacketProtocol is not threadsafe, so the instance members of this class must be synchronized when necessary.
