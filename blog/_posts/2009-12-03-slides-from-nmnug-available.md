title: "Slides from nmNUG Available"
---
Last month I spoke at nmNUG (the [Northern Michigan .NET User's Group](http://nmichigan.net/)) on the topic of multithreading.

It wasn't my best presentation: I spoke too fast, had too many slides and not enough code, and assumed a level of existing knowledge that was too high (I had assumed that everyone had done _some_ multithreading, but this was not the case). Even with my mistakes, though, it was still helpful for many.

Slides are available [here](http://nmichigan.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Multithreading.pptx). Topics include an overview of IAsyncResult, challenges in correctly marshaling events, more information on SynchronizationContext than anyone wants to know ;) , and a small amount of asynchronous component design.
