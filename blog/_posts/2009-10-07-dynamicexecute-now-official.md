Version 3.5.4.0 of the [MSBuild Extension Pack](https://github.com/mikefourie-zz/MSBuildExtensionPack) has recently been released!

This release of the project includes my DynamicExecute class [(online docs)](http://www.msbuildextensionpack.com/help/3.5.4.0/html/2e32aa32-13c7-6374-e53e-241ff534fe1c.htm), which allows build masters to include C# code right in their MSBuild scripts. This code is compiled and executed at build time, which provides a whole new level of MSBuild extensibility.

If you've ever found yourself frustrated by the lack of MSBuild usability, this should come as a real relief. :)
