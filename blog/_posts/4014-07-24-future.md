Logging:
- Structured Logging / Semantic Logging
  - Usually written to JSON and sent to an ElasticSearch backend.
  - Other possibilities exist, e.g., ETW.
  - Example queries, usually inspired by Lucene. Restrict by CorrelationId, or HttpResponseCode:(>=400 AND <500)
- Logging.
  - The easy way.
  - The Right Way(tm).
- Logging scope messages and scope values.
- Implementing a provider: ILoggerProvider and ILogger combo.
- Implementing ILoggerProvider.CreateLogger. ConcurrentDictionary.
- Implementing ILogger.IsEnabled.
- Implementing ILogger.Log.
- What is Scope? https://andrewlock.net/using-anonymous-types-and-tuples-to-attach-correlation-ids-to-scope-state-with-serilog-and-seq-in-asp-net-core/
- Implementing ILogger.BeginScope (2.1)
- Implementing ILogger.BeginScope (old-school)
- Final notes on ILoggerProvider: ILoggerFactory extension methods.

Updated Best Practices in Async Programming: tables with Dos and Don'ts
Write new version of length-prefix code using Span<T>.

The many meanings of ".NET Core".

Update framework profiles post.

Versions:
[AssemblyVersion] <AssemblyVersion/> -> Used by Strong-Name Signing
[AssemblyFileVersion] <FileVersion/> -> Used by Explorer ("File version")
[AssemblyFileInformationalVersion] <Version/> -> Used by Explorer ("Product version")
TODO: hierarchy
- Which ones are created by others.
- How things behave when absent.

Eliding async local: https://mail.google.com/mail/ca/u/0/#inbox/15d898a04a7dda7c

Soon:
- Update ASP.NET post(s) to refer to https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn589781.aspx

async javascript
- promises complete asynchronously
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all#Promise.all_fail-fast_behaviour

- "In parallel" vs "parallel processing".

Synchronization primitives: when to use what?
Lock
Monitor
Condition Variable
Semaphore
ManualResetEvent
AutoResetEvent
CountdownEvent
ReaderWriterLock

- Testing timing code.
  - The problem with using delays in testing (including timers, Task.Delay, and Thread.Sleep). Resolution, unguaranteed (esp on busy machine / small instances).
  - Rx's IScheduler and TestScheduler.
  - Polly's time abstraction.
  - Using MSFakes (VSUltimate) to hook into Task.Delay / CancellationTokenSource.CancelAfter / etc.

- child process with async WaitForExit and redirected I/O.
- Railway programming for TPL Dataflow.
- ValueTask<T>
- async Win32 service complete with cancel & pause. Also show use of AsyncContextThread.
- async/await, IDisposable/using, nullable types?.
- async in other languages: Dart, JS, https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/
- calling asynchronous code from synchronous code
- Cancellation
- Progress
- ObservableDisposable: CreateForUi and IObservable<T>
- await & dynamic
- async ninject/dynamicproxy
  - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15199447/return-await-method-invoke/15203215#15203215
- unit testing asynchronous timeout scenarios (using Rx TestScheduler)
- What the *Async/*TaskAsync suffix means
- Chat sample: TCP/IP sockets vs. SignalR
- At the lowest level of async: controlling a device driver. OVERLAPPED with TaskCompletionSource.
  - Device driver can just be an "integer queue" - 32-bit ints can be queued or dequeued (which will wait until one arrives, if necessary). Requires monitor.
  - Or can be a keyboard filter driver.
- async javascript: promises (always async)
- taskcompletionsource and es6 promises
  - promises always complete asynchronously
  - unhandled exception behavior
- translation to+from TCS and js promises for embedded js code

Part 12 - Task.Factory.FromAsync, TaskCompletionSource, and TaskExtensions.Unwrap

Part 13 - ConfigureAwait, Yield, and Dispose
- ConfigureAwait
- Dispose

Part 14 - .NET 4.6? Or just go back and rewrite everything?

Misc TODOs:
- Update async delegates post to have clearer pairs in the tables.
- Update eliding post to not dispose HttpClient.
