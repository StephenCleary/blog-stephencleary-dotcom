- Modern HTTP Client Best Practices (for the cloud world)
  - Authentication as a message handler.
    - Caching authentication secrets.
    - Responding to authentication secrets being refreshed.
  - Polly and retries.
    - Exponential backoff and decorrelated jitter with immediate first retry and ceiling.
    - Transient HTTP errors.
      - Manually include 429 for some reason.
    - Consider the placement of retry message handler with relation to authentication message handler.
    - Complete retry example with exponential backoff and decorrelated jitter with immediate first retry and ceiling.
  - Giving up.
    - Polly policy wrapping, using Timeout as an example.
    - Use Polly timeouts, not HttpClient.Timeout: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19260060/retrying-httpclient-unsuccessful-requests (see all comments); https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/wiki/Polly-and-HttpClientFactory#use-case-applying-timeouts
    - Advanced notes: Polly also supports caching and circuit breaking (for your own APIs).
  - Logging.
    - Default logging: information and trace levels. No Fiddler necessary!
      - "Inner" and "Outer" logging.
    - Correlation ids. (place in service class so they apply to outer handler and possibly multiple requests treated as a single logical unit)
    - Anything else. E.g., RUs consumed, server-side request ids. (place in delegating handler)
  - Refit for defining APIs more cleanly.
  - Refit + `HttpClientFactory`.
  - Make your own AddMyService extension method.
  - Complete example code. Include repository with utility types.
  - Worked example: GitHub
  - Worked example: CosmosDb?
  - Worked example: Auth0?
  - Worked example: Stripe?

- Cancellation
  - Cooperative. Pass-down for the "90% case".
    - Cancellation contract.
    - Exception to the pass-down rule: Task.Run.
  - (Requesting) Signalling cancellation: timers and manual.
  - (Requesting) Detecting cancellation: OperationCanceledException and TaskCanceledException. Ignore CancellationToken; use IsCancellationRequested instead.
  - (Requesting) Cleaning up CancellationTokenSources. Always cancel or dispose.
  - (Responding) Polling for cancellation (common in synchronous / CPU-based methods).
  - (Responding) Registering for cancellation (common in asynchronous / IO-based methods). Cleaning up registrations.
  - Sharp corner: Linking cancellation tokens. The danger of multiple cancellation tokens and OperationCanceledException.CancellationToken from the Outer perspective.
  - Sharp corner: Synchronous cancellation callbacks.
  - Uncancelable code: Closing handles. Common Win32 approach when the individual operations are uncancelable.
  - Uncancelable code: Canceling waits. Danger of canceling waits. Polly's term: "Pessimistic"; have to opt-in.
  - Uncancelable code: External process. The only reliable and safe general-purpose solution.

Updated example of Auth0 + Azure Functions

- Modern Auth0 (SPA SDK, no more implicit flow)
- Modern Azure Functions (v3, .NET Core 3.1)

Logging:
- Structured Logging / Semantic Logging
  - Usually written to JSON and sent to an ElasticSearch backend.
  - Other possibilities exist, e.g., ETW.
  - Example queries, usually inspired by Lucene. Restrict by CorrelationId, or HttpResponseCode:(>=400 AND <500)
- Logging.
  - The easy way.
  - The Right Way(tm).
- Logging scope messages and scope values.
- Implementing a provider: ILoggerProvider and ILogger combo.
- Implementing ILoggerProvider.CreateLogger. ConcurrentDictionary.
- Implementing ILogger.IsEnabled.
- Implementing ILogger.Log.

async javascript

  - The problem with using delays in testing (including timers, Task.Delay, and Thread.Sleep). Resolution, unguaranteed (esp on busy machine / small instances).
  - Rx's IScheduler and TestScheduler.
  - Polly's time abstraction.
  - Using MSFakes (VSUltimate) to hook into Task.Delay / CancellationTokenSource.CancelAfter / etc.

- child process with async WaitForExit and redirected I/O.
- Railway programming for TPL Dataflow.

- unit testing asynchronous timeout scenarios (using Rx TestScheduler)
- What the *Async/*TaskAsync suffix means
- Chat sample: TCP/IP sockets vs. SignalR
- At the lowest level of async: controlling a device driver. OVERLAPPED with TaskCompletionSource.
  - Device driver can just be an "integer queue" - 32-bit ints can be queued or dequeued (which will wait until one arrives, if necessary). Requires monitor.
  - Or can be a keyboard filter driver.
- async javascript: promises (always async)
- taskcompletionsource and es6 promises
  - promises always complete asynchronously
  - unhandled exception behavior
- translation to+from TCS and js promises for embedded js code

Part 12 - Task.Factory.FromAsync, TaskCompletionSource, and TaskExtensions.Unwrap

Part 13 - ConfigureAwait, Yield, and Dispose
- ConfigureAwait

Part 14 - .NET 4.6? Or just go back and rewrite everything?

More of Your Conversation Would Infect My Brain. (Comparison in .NET, Part the Third)
- Nito.Comparers has more major revisions than any other library I've written. It has N unit tests.
  - Please use it.
- Default treatment of `null`.
- The problem of `null` with comparer `GetHashCode` implementations. And English words.
- Exceptions: avoiding the unavoidable.
- Weird edge cases, and how the framework comparers handle them.
- Equality vs Equivalence vs Identity (?)
  - Value types and reference types.
  - Substitutability and equivalence. Also ephemerons.
  - Possibly other languages, e.g., how JS handles value types.
- Floating-point values and non-equivalent "equality".
  - NaN != NaN (JS: undefined != undefined)
  - "Close enough" equality comparison is not associative.
    - Consider three very close floating point values (a, b, c): a = b and b = c but a != c.
    - You can implement the `Equals` method but not the `Equals` contract.
    - E.g., consider a dictionary using a "close enough" equality comparer. `dict[a] = 5; dict[c] = 7; dict[b] = 13;` - is `a` or `c` overwritten? They're both equal to `b` but not each other.
  - Recommendation: use a completely different API, like `CloseEnough` instead of `Equals` to make it clear it's not an equivalence relation.
  - `HashSet.SetEquals`
- Weak partial ordering (?)
  - https://stackoverflow.com/a/16694905/263693
  - Object instances cannot be reasonably compared.
  - Example of sorting by collection size when elements cannot be compared. Equivalent sets that are not equal (and cannot be compared).
  - Regular sorts tend to assume total order, which works fine for sorting equivalence classes. For weak partial orders, you can use stable sorts or topological sorts.
