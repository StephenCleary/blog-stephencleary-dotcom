Soon:
- Update ASP.NET post(s) to refer to https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn589781.aspx

- async/await, IDisposable/using, nullable types?.
- async in other languages: Dart, JS, https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/
- calling asynchronous code from synchronous code
- Cancellation
- Progress
- ObservableDisposable: CreateForUi and IObservable<T>
- await & dynamic
- async ninject/dynamicproxy
  - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15199447/return-await-method-invoke/15203215#15203215
- unit testing asynchronous timeout scenarios (using Rx TestScheduler)
- What the *Async/*TaskAsync suffix means
- Chat sample: TCP/IP sockets vs. SignalR
- At the lowest level of async: controlling a device driver. OVERLAPPED with TaskCompletionSource.
  - Device driver can just be an "integer queue" - 32-bit ints can be queued or dequeued (which will wait until one arrives, if necessary). Requires monitor.
  - Or can be a keyboard filter driver.
- async javascript: requirejs
- taskcompletionsource and es6 promises
  - promises always complete asynchronously
  - unhandled exception behavior
- translation to+from TCS and js promises for embedded js code

Part 12 - Task.Factory.FromAsync, TaskCompletionSource, and TaskExtensions.Unwrap

Part 13 - ConfigureAwait, Yield, and Dispose
- ConfigureAwait
- Dispose

Part 14 - .NET 4.6? Or just go back and rewrite everything?
