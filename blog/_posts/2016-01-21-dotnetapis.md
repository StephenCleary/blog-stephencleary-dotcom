I've been heads-down for quite a while working on a new project that *just went live!*

[DotNetApis](http://dotnetapis.com) is a website that provides documentation for NuGet packages.

The purpose of this site is twofold: first, to provide reference documentation for developers while they are coding; and second, to provide an easy way for authors to publish reference documentation for their libraries. DotNetApis keeps its URLs stable and human-readable (mostly), so it's a great way to link to types in online discussions, too.

The site is currently in Beta, so it's not feature-complete yet, but I believe it's finished enough to be useful to others, so I'm publishing it today.

Please try it out, and let me know what you think!
