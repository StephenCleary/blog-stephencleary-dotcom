title: "Announcement: MSDN \"async MVVM\" articles"

Oops, not sure how I missed making this announcement! Sorry for the late notice!

I have two articles published recently in MSDN magazine, both dealing with patterns for async MVVM applications. The first one is on [asynchronous MVVM data-binding](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn605875.aspx?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-5000058), and the second one is on [asynchronous MVVM commands](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn630647.aspx?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-5000058).
