This is more of a minor/feature change, but one of the bug fixes required an API change, so it is technically considered a major release.

The big changes in this update are:

- iOS and Android support! Yay!
- Strong named DLLs.
- Had to change the cancellation token helper APIs to solve a memory leak possibility.
