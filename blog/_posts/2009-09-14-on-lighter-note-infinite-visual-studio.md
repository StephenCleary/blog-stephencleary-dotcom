A bit earlier this summer, I was loading some Compact Framework code when this interesting error popped up. The error message is very detailed but completely meaningless to me.





The most fun part of this error is that it was an "infinite error" - that is, no matter how many times you would click the "OK" button, the same exact error would pop up again. Eventually, I had to kill Visual Studio to reclaim my machine.
