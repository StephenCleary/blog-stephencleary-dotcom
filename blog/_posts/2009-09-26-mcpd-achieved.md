Today I passed 70-505 and 70-563, officially becoming a Microsoft Certified Professional Developer (Windows Developer 3.5 on Visual Studio 2008). Then I got to return home and feed our baby for the first time! :)

Baby has been sick this week, so once again my preparation for these exams was lacking. By the grace of God, however, I did pass.

Now I'm thinking, why not go for the Enterprise Developer certification before the end of the year? It's only four more exams. Hmmm... Maybe.
