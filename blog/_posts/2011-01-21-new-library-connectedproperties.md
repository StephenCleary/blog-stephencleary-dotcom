title: "New Library: ConnectedProperties"
---
The first version of [ConnectedProperties](https://github.com/StephenCleary/ConnectedProperties) has been released (on both GitHub and NuGet).

It's a very simple library that allows you to dynamically attach properties to (most) objects at runtime. It uses the [ConditionalWeakTable]({% post_url 2010-12-21-conditionalweaktable %}) I posted about last month, but adds some wrapping to ensure it's used correctly.

Download it, check it out, and leave some feedback (on GitHub or the NuGet gallery, as appropriate)!
