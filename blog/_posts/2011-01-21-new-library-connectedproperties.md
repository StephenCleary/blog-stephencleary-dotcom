title: "New Library: ConnectedProperties"
---
The first version of [ConnectedProperties](http://connectedproperties.codeplex.com/) has been released (on both CodePlex and NuGet).



It's a very simple library that allows you to dynamically attach properties to (most) objects at runtime. It uses the [ConditionalWeakTable]({% post_url 2010-12-21-conditionalweaktable %}) I posted about last month, but adds some wrapping to ensure it's used correctly.



Download it, check it out, and leave some feedback (on CodePlex or the NuGet gallery, as appropriate)!
