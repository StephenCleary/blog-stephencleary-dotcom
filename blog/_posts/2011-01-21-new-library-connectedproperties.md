The first version of [ConnectedProperties](http://connectedproperties.codeplex.com/) has been released (on both CodePlex and NuGet).





It's a very simple library that allows you to dynamically attach properties to (most) objects at runtime. It uses the [ConditionalWeakTable](http://blog.stephencleary.com/2010/12/conditionalweaktable.html) I posted about last month, but adds some wrapping to ensure it's used correctly.





Download it, check it out, and leave some feedback (on CodePlex or the NuGet gallery, as appropriate)!
