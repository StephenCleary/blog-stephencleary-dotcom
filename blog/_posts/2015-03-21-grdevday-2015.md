Once again I had the privilege of speaking at [Grand Rapids DevDay 2015](http://grdevday.org/), my "most local" conference. Someday I'll write up a bit more about GRDevDay, but for now I'll just say it's a conference I always enjoy. :)

My morning talk was **Introduction to Async and Await**. Believe it or not, this was my first time presenting just an async intro talk at a conference. It went pretty well once I got the projector working. :)

Slides and demo code are [available on GitHub](https://github.com/StephenCleary/Presentations/tree/57ff9987955ae098ddfd4b4c46201e0eeeeae49f/Intro%20to%20Async).

My afternoon talk is on **Async Unit Testing**. Full slides and demo are also [available on GitHub](https://github.com/StephenCleary/Presentations/tree/9173ae58793ae0dd10ab0af0840656121e0cb8b9/Async%20Unit%20Testing).
