A short post today just to announce a new project of mine: [AsyncTime!](https://vimeo.com/ondemand/asynctime)

[AsyncTime](https://vimeo.com/ondemand/asynctime) is a series of short videos covering subjects that work better in a video format rather than a blog post format. Some of the videos will be only for subscribers, but I'm kicking off the channel with several big-picture videos that are free for everyone!

I hope this is a benefit for you; I'm certainly looking forward to it!
