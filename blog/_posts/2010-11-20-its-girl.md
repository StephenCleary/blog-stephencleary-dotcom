title: "It's a Girl!"
---
I am pleased to announce that Emma Rose Cleary was born at 12:17pm on Saturday, November 20th, 2010. She was a grand total of 7 lbs, 11 oz, and was 20 inches long. She joins her brother Stephen Daniel, who was born 2009-07-29.



She is the most beautiful girl in the world (though I cannot claim an impartial perspective). We have been so blessed!
