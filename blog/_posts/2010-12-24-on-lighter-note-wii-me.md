title: "On a Lighter Note: \"Wii Me\"?"
---
Advances in technology often cause changes in language. Most people these days know what a "tweet" is, even if they don't use the term themselves.

This last Wednesday shortly before [church](http://www.landmarkbaptist.ws/), I asked one of the fellows if I had his email address. He replied, "Wii me." This is the first time I'd heard that term, and - even though the meaning was [obvious](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Menu#Message_Board) - I had to pause for a moment before replying "_Wii_ you??"

I don't think the phrase "Wii me" will catch on, but we both had a good laugh over it. :)
