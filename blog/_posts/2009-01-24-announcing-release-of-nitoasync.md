Nito Programs has released its first significant library as open-source:  

  [http://www.codeplex.com/NitoAsync](http://www.codeplex.com/NitoAsync)

This library makes it easier to develop framework-agnostic components that use the [event-based asynchronous pattern](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wewwczdw.aspx).

What exactly this means - and why you might care - will be expounded on in the next few blog posts.
