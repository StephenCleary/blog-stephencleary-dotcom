For those of you who are wondering why I haven't been blogging much the last few weeks, the biggest reason is [right here](http://picasaweb.google.com/stephenandmandy/StephenDanielTheFirstYear?feat=directlink) - our first baby! He does keep us up at night, but he makes up for it by being cute!





The other reason is that I'm preparing to give my first programming-related presentation ever. It will be on TCP/IP application protocol design, and will be given at [BarCamp Grand Rapids 4](http://barcampgr.org/wiki/BarCampGrandRapids4) this weekend. I'll post a link to the slides sometime in the next few days.
