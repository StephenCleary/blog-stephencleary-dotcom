title: "Announcement: Speaking at ThatConference"

I have been chosen to speak at [ThatConference](http://www.thatconference.com/)!

I'm a little nervous since I have not attended ThatConference before, but I have been to CodeMash twice so that counts for something, right?

My session is [Scaling Your Servers with Async/Await](http://www.thatconference.com/Sessions/session_630). I'll be covering all kinds of helpful information on developing with async/await on the server side. Most async/await talks focus on the client side - and don't me wrong, async/await is certainly needed for client apps! - but server-side async is often overlooked or put on the back burner. I'll be addressing server-side async from concepts to best practices to diagnostics.

I'm really excited for my talk, and I hope to see you there!
