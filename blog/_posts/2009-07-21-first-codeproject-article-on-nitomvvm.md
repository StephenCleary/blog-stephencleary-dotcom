title: "First CodeProject Article on Nito.MVVM"
---
The [first Nito.MVVM CodeProject article](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/38351/The-Nito-MVVM-WPF-Library-Commands) is up! This article describes the ICommand implementations that are in the [Nito.MVVM library](https://github.com/StephenCleary/Mvvm), along with some comparisions to existing work.

The Nito.MVVM library is still a ways away from its first release, but what's there should be stable. Unit tests are included. :)
