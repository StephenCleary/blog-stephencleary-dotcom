title: "First CodeProject Article on Nito.MVVM"
---
The [first Nito.MVVM CodeProject article](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/WPF/NitoMVVMCommands.aspx) is up! This article describes the ICommand implementations that are in the [Nito.MVVM library](http://nitomvvm.codeplex.com/), along with some comparisions to existing work.

The Nito.MVVM library is still a ways away from its first release, but what's there should be stable. Unit tests are included. :)
