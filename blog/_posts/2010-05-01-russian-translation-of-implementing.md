So, I was poking around [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) today just for fun, and noticed that someone translated my post ["How to Implement IDisposable and Finalizers: 3 Simple Rules"](http://blog.stephencleary.com/2009/08/how-to-implement-idisposable-and.html) into [Russian](http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/net/89720/). The translated article also includes each of my detailed posts.





Cool! :)
