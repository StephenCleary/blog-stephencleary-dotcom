title: "Russian Translation of \"Implementing IDisposable and Finalizers: 3 Simple Rules\""
---
So, I was poking around [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) today just for fun, and noticed that someone translated my post ["How to Implement IDisposable and Finalizers: 3 Simple Rules"]({% post_url 2009-08-27-how-to-implement-idisposable-and %}) into [Russian](http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/net/89720/). The translated article also includes each of my detailed posts.

Cool! :)
