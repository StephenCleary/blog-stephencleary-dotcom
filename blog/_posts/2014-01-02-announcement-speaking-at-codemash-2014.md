title: "Announcement: Speaking at CodeMash 2014"
---
This is just a short blog post to announce that I am speaking at [CodeMash 2014](http://codemash.org/) in Sandusky, Ohio, on Thursday, January 9th at 11:00am - exactly one week from now (there are always a few last-minute schedule adjustments, so be sure to double-check the time after arriving at the conference).



My talk is titled "Async on the Server". It will be similar to my [talk from ThatConference 2013]({% post_url 2013-08-13-slides-available-thatconference-2013 %}), but I'm rewriting it to be much more of an "_introduction_ to async on ASP.NET" instead of my ThatConference talk which was more like "assuming you already know async, here's all the advanced stuff you need to know to make it work perfectly on any kind of server". I think this may actually be the very first time I've given a beginner-level talk, so we'll see how it goes. :)



I'm quite excited to have this speaking opportunity, and I hope folks will be able to come to it!
