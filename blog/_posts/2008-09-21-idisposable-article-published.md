Today I published my first article on CodeProject: [IDisposable: What Your Mother Never Told You About Resource Deallocation](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/dotnet/IDisposable.aspx). It's a description of the problems with IDisposable and introduces the Disposable Design Principle as a better alternative to Microsoft's recommended IDisposable code pattern.
