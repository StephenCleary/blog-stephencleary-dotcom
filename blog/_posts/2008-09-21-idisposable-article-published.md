Today I published my first article on CodeProject: [IDisposable: What Your Mother Never Told You About Resource Deallocation](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/29534/IDisposable-What-Your-Mother-Never-Told-You-About). It's a description of the problems with IDisposable and introduces the Disposable Design Principle as a better alternative to Microsoft's recommended IDisposable code pattern.
