Mobile-first? You know what that means: Async-first! Is the world of async/await passing you by? No need to worry with this catchup session! Join async guru Stephen Cleary for a down-to-earth introduction to the new async and await keywords. No previous expertise required! We'll cover just what you need to know as a developer: where async helps (and where it doesn't), how it works (without unnecessary details), and best practices to get you started on your async adventure!</p></a>
        <a href="http://youtu.be/k81OaT_P6K0" class="list-group-item clearfix"><h2 class="pull-right"><small>SubMain</small></h2><h2>Asynchronous Programming Demystified</h2><p>Asynchronous code using the new async and await keywords seems to be everywhere these days! These keywords are transforming the way programs are written. Yet many developers feel unsure about Async programming. This webcast covers: How the async and await keywords really work; How to think about asynchronous code; The difference between asynchrony and parallelism; Common mistakes when learning asynchronous programming; Fixing Async code smells with CodeIt.Right.</p></a>

This article discusses a variety of approaches to introducing asynchronous code while maintaining backwards compatibility.</p></a>
        <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn818493.aspx?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-5000058" class="list-group-item clearfix"><h2 class="pull-right"><small>MSDN Magazine, November 2014</small></h2><h2>Unit Testing Asynchronous Code</h2><p>An exhaustive look at unit testing <code>async</code> methods. This article covers the basics of unit testing <code>async</code> methods, mocking techniques, and special considerations. Also includes an overview of the current status of common unit testing frameworks (MSTest, xUnit, and NUnit) as well as some helper libraries (e.g., Moq, Microsoft Fakes), with a look at future directions.</p></a>

But does <code>async</code> have a role to play on the server? The answer is most definitely "yes!" This article examines <code>async</code> on ASP.NET applications: the benefits of <code>async</code>, how it works in an ASP.NET environment, and common pitfalls to avoid.</p></a>
