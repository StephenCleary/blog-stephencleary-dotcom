These keywords are transforming the way programs are written. Yet many developers feel unsure about Async programming. This webcast covers: How the async and await keywords really work; How to think about asynchronous code; The difference between asynchrony and parallelism; Common mistakes when learning asynchronous programming; Fixing Async code smells with CodeIt.Right.</p></a>

This article covers the basics of unit testing <code>async</code> methods, mocking techniques, and special considerations. Also includes an overview of the current status of common unit testing frameworks (MSTest, xUnit, and NUnit) as well as some helper libraries (e.g., Moq, Microsoft Fakes), with a look at future directions.</p></a>

But does <code>async</code> have a role to play on the server? The answer is most definitely "yes!" This article examines <code>async</code> on ASP.NET applications: the benefits of <code>async</code>, how it works in an ASP.NET environment, and common pitfalls to avoid.</p></a>
