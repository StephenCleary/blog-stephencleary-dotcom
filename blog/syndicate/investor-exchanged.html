    <h1>The Cleary Cryptocurrency Syndicate: Investor Exchanged Option</h1>
    <p>If you are planning to pursue this option, it's best to get the ball rolling early. There's a detailed verification process that takes some time.</p>
    
    <h2>To Invest (Small Amounts)</h2>
    <p>Investing small amounts - e.g., $50-$250 - you can use <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a>:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Sign up for a new account.</li>
        <li>Add a bank or credit card. Banks require deposit verification.</li>
        <li><a href="https://support.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2498522-how-do-i-buy-ethereum-">Buy Ether.</a> Be sure to save a hard copy of the transaction details!</li>
        <li><a href="https://support.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/971437-how-do-i-send-digital-currency-">Send the Ether</a> to the syndicate's account <code>5c41fbe25f4ac0f9ca75b1439dc2b66798de4be4</code> (copy and paste this; do not type it!)</li>
        <li>Remove your bank and credit card accounts.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>To Invest (Large Amounts)</h2>
    <p>To invest larger amounts, I recommend <a href="https://www.kraken.com/">Kraken</a>, <a href="https://gemini.com/">Gemini</a>, or <a href="https://cex.io">Cex</a>.</p>
    <p>The verification procedure for these sites is much more rigorous than Coinbase, requiring photo id and a lot of personal details.</p>
    <p>The basic procedure is the same:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Sign up for a new account.</li>
        <li>Add a bank or credit card.</li>
        <li>Buy Ether. NOTE: Ether is ETH. This is <b>completely different</b> than Ethereum Classic (ETC). You want ETH; you do <b>not</b> want ETC. Be sure to save a hard copy of the transaction details!</li>
        <li>Send the Ether to the syndicate's account <code>5c41fbe25f4ac0f9ca75b1439dc2b66798de4be4</code> (copy and paste this; do not type it!)</li>
        <li>Remove your bank and credit card accounts.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>To Withdraw</h2>
    <p>You can sell ETH using any exchange (it doesn't have to be the same one that you used to buy ETH). In 5-10 years, it's quite possible that today's exchanges are no more, and you'd need to choose a new one anyway.</p>
    <p>The basic procedure would go like this:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Sign up for a new account (or use an existing account if you have one already at that exchange).</li>
        <li>Add a bank account. Make careful note of the withdraw limits.</li>
        <li>Request a withdraw from the syndicate, sending me your ETH wallet address (copy and paste this; do not type it!)</li>
        <li>When the Ether arrives in your wallet, you can then exchange it to USD. Note that this is a taxable event!</li>
        <li>Withdraw the USD from the exchange into your bank account.</li>
        <li>Remove your bank account from the exchange.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Some important notes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The US government gets very nervous when people deposit large amounts of money into their bank accounts. There are lots of regulations around how much money can be transferred, and even if you are within the regulatory limits, your transactions may be delayed far beyond what you'd expect.</li>
        <li>One common pitfall is to exchange the entire investment amount to USD immediately (causing capital gains tax on the entire amount in that year), and then being unable to withdraw enough to actually pay the taxes on it!</li>
        <li>To avoid this scenario, I recommend only exchanging portions of your investment at a time, so that you can spread out the taxable events until you have enough investment income to cover the taxes.</li>
        <li>Exchange wallets are less secure than the syndicate wallets. For increased security, you can request multiple transfers from the syndicate account over time, but you'd have to pay the transfer fee each time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Skipping the Syndicate</h2>
    <p>If you're going through the trouble of purchasing Ether yourself directly anyway, you may decide to hold the investment yourself without entering the syndicate. If you choose to do this, you should keep some things in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You will want to place your accounts in what is called "cold storage". Most exchanges have this as a built-in option these days. This prevents criminals from stealing your ETH by hacking the exchange site (which is very likely to happen over the next 5-10 years).</li>
        <li>Even if your accounts are in "cold storage", you will need to access them through the exchange, since technically they are owned by the exchange. If the exchange itself fails as a company (which is much less likely to happen), you could possibly be permanently locked out of your funds. Most exchanges are insured, but this only covers you up to a few hundred grand.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The syndicate avoids both of these problems by having its own cold storage wallet, which is not part of any exchange.</p>
